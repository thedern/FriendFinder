# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a Node/Express application that presents the user with a questionnaire containing personality-type questions.  Those questions are then scored and compared against a bank of pre-collected personality data of others who have taken the same questionnaire. Scores most similar are matched and a 'compatible' friend is then presented to the user.
